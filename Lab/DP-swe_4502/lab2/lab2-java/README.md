# Lab 2 - Strategy Pattern

## Introduction

In this lab, we will implement the Strategy Pattern. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family. The Strategy Pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

## Objective

Implement the Strategy Pattern to create a set of algorithms that can be selected at runtime. The Strategy Pattern should be implemented in a way that allows the client to select the algorithm that they want to use. Here, we will implement the Strategy Pattern to let the Rider select the preferred type of payment method.
